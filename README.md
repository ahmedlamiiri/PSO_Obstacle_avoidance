# PSO_Obstacle_avoidance
Real-time obstacle avoidance using a modified Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm for optimal path planning. The system processes camera-based perception to detect obstacles and dynamically adjust the trajectory, ensuring smooth and efficient navigation in real-world environments.
