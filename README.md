# Obstacle Avoidance using Modified Particle Swarm Optimization 🚀  

**Real-Time Path Planning & Obstacle Avoidance** using a modified **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** algorithm.  
This project enables an autonomous agent to navigate **optimally** while avoiding obstacles in **real-time** using **camera-based perception**.  

## 🔹 Features  
✅ **Optimal Path Planning** – Enhanced PSO for efficient navigation.  
✅ **Real-Time Obstacle Avoidance** – Detects and avoids obstacles dynamically.  
✅ **Computer Vision Integration** – Uses camera data for intelligent decision-making.  
✅ **Fast & Adaptive** – Designed for real-world environments with quick response times.  

## 🔹 Technologies Used  
🔸 **Python** | **OpenCV** | **TensorFlow** (if ML-based perception) | **ROS** (if robotic system)  
🔸 **Modified PSO Algorithm** for adaptive navigation  

## 🔹 How It Works  
1️⃣ **Camera Perception** – Captures real-time environment data.  
2️⃣ **Obstacle Detection** – Identifies obstacles using image processing.  
3️⃣ **Path Planning** – Runs a modified PSO to find the optimal collision-free path.  
4️⃣ **Navigation Execution** – Guides the agent along the computed trajectory.  

## 🔹 Installation & Usage  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmedlamiiri/obstacle-avoidance-pso.git
cd obstacle-avoidance-pso
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
