#Obstacle Avoidance using Modified Particle Swarm Optimization
ðŸš€ Real-Time Path Planning & Obstacle Avoidance using a modified Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. This project enables an autonomous agent to navigate optimally while avoiding obstacles in real-time using camera-based perception.

ðŸ”¹ Features
âœ… Optimal Path Planning â€“ Uses an enhanced PSO algorithm for efficient route optimization.
âœ… Real-Time Obstacle Avoidance â€“ Dynamically detects and avoids obstacles using live camera data.
âœ… Computer Vision Integration â€“ Processes visual input for intelligent decision-making.
âœ… Fast & Adaptive â€“ Designed for real-world environments with quick response times.

ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used
ðŸ”¸ Python | OpenCV | TensorFlow (if ML-based perception is used) | ROS (if robotic system)
ðŸ”¸ Modified PSO Algorithm for adaptive navigation

ðŸ”¹ How It Works
Camera Perception: Captures real-time environment data.
Obstacle Detection: Identifies obstacles using image processing.
Path Planning: Runs a modified PSO to find the optimal collision-free path.
Navigation Execution: Guides the agent along the computed trajectory.

ðŸ”¹ Installation & Usage
git clone https://github.com/ahmedlamiiri/obstacle-avoidance-pso.git
cd obstacle-avoidance-pso
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

ðŸ”¹ Future Improvements
âœ… Integration with LiDAR / Depth Sensors
âœ… Optimization for Multi-Agent Systems
âœ… Hardware Deployment (Drones, Robots)
